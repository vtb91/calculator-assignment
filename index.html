<P class="main-text">
The reckoning around data privacy on social media sites has taken center stage as Facebook has come under intense scrutiny in the past weeks. The company is facing more blowback from users, regulators, and investors following reports that its user data was misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. <br> <br>

There are signs that data privacy rules may soon become a reality. On Tuesday, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before congress to testify about his company’s data privacy lapses. <br> <br>

US technology companies have largely stayed exempt from significant government regulation. Currently, no federal law exists that spells out what companies trading in personal information can do with user data. Congress and federal agencies are already considering different options to regulate Facebook and other social media sites. <br> <br>

“I work with a few data companies who build models that target users based on their digital footprint and social media history,” said Savannah Johnson, a Marketing specialist at Williams-Sonoma. <br> <br>

Johnson is conscious of trying to safeguard her privacy on social media while leveraging it’s benefits for her day job. <br> <br>

“Because it’s my job I’ve personally become really good at knowing what not to subscribe to or even click on, but I think for the majority of people there is a huge grey area and they give away tons of information, usually legally, without even knowing it”. <br> <br>

In a November 2017 <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-and-congress-did-themselves-no-favors-in-hearings-1513306706-0112094a-3280-44f5-a246-136741d36e9f.html">poll</a>, only about four in 10 Americans were concerned that the government wouldn’t do enough to regulate tech companies. In a February poll, that number has jumped to 55 percent. <br> <br>

Despite these misgivings, the amount of time Americans spend on social media is only rising. Growth on many of the top social media platforms <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/">continue to increase</a>. Just on Facebooks suite of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram) users are spending an average of 50 minutes a day. <br> <br>

“It’s good to see Facebook under the spotlight, it’s nice to finally see some accountability on their part,” Johnson said. <br> <br>
